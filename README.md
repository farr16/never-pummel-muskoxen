# GetIt
Repository for __GetIt__, the crowd-sourced study set making, question and answer formatted study companion app from {{teamname}}

## Overview

__GetIt__'s core functionality is the creation of "study sets" for specific topics. The study sets contain flashcards which consist 
of a question and an answer. After registering or logging in to __GetIt__, users will be able to create study sets, add questions 
to them, and add answers to those questions. Users will be able to browse study sets submitted by other users. The author of a study 
set will be able to grant edit permissions to other users, allowing the other users to edit answers or submit questions to the study 
set.

Additional functionality will be allowing users to create "study sessions", meetups at a specific location and time to study a
particular topic. Users will be able to create study sessions and specify their location and time. Other users will be able to view 
the available study sessions and RSVP to them.

A potential "stretch goal" for additional functionality will be the creation of multiple choice question and answer views based on
specific study sets. These views will use the questions and answers provided in the flashcards, and additional answers entered in by
the users, to generate a multiple choic quiz for the study set, which users will be able to take to test their comprehension of the
material.
